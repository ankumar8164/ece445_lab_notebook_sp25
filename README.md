## 2025-01-26 - Initial Discussion with Teammates

The three of us met for the first time and began discussing the problem further. The initial idea was a generalized type of cup to brew different drinks and allow for both heating and cooling. As we spoke with each other and the TAs, we realized that the cooling aspect would be difficult, as while there are numerous options for heating, there are few or no well-accepted methods for cooling. We thus pivoted to a more specialized project: a self-regulating thermos for brewing tea. Different tea leaves require different water temperatures for brewing, and the goal of this thermos is to handle these aspects for the user. We also brainstormed additional features such as a motor for stirring (to ensure even water distribution and tea strength) and a Bluetooth connection to the user's phone to allow them to control the thermos.

## 2025-02-03 - Reflection on Working with Tea Strength

One important aspect of the tea drinking experience (other than temperature of course) is the strength of the tea. This is a very subjective metric, so our first goal is to try and assign actual values to these. We settled on using a Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) sensor to accomplish this task. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be any existing literature on this. As such, we decided that we would likely have to brew cups of tea ourselves, make an opinion on the strength and measure the TDS value to correlate those numbers to tea strengths.

## 2025-02-25 - Meeting with TAs and Professors

We met with the professor and TAs to present our project proposal. We discussed the different components we planned on implementing as well as additional aspect susch as safety and ethics. We also got some good ideas on alternative solutions if needed. For instance, the professor suggested that if the TDS idea does not work, we could use some sort of light / color sensor, as a stronger tea would have a more opaque color and allow less light through.
